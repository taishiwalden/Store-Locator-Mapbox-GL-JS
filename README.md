# Store-Locator-Mapbox-GL-JS

## Building an interactive pub crawl using Mapbox GL JS
Created an interactive pub crawl map with bars and clubs in Ballard, Seattle. Includes a loading screen animation (pitch, bearing, rotation). A project created for a startup media company called [Visneto](https://www.visnetomedia.com/). The HTML file above does not contain the code necessary for sidebar interactivity or screen animations.
